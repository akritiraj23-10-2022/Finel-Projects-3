How It Works:  Pagers.

Pagers... those ubiquitous &quot;beepers&quot; that always seem to be going off during meetings.  Ever wonder how they can make them so small?  How do they run for so long on just a penlight cell, when everything else needs big batteries that have to be recharged every night?

The pager's secret is that inside that little case is a simple, yet sophisticated receiver.  With the exception of two-way pagers (more on that later), pagers don't have a transmitter.  Since it is the transmitter that consumes the lion's share of battery power in portable communications devices, pagers have a real edge when it comes to saving batteries.  No transmitter also means that the pager can be made smaller than other communications devices too.
